          Never embed session keys in config files or repository artefacts.
          When a key is required (for example Obfuscated3.lua), pass it via
          CLI or stdin during the parity harness step and wipe buffers after use.

    # This example workflow intentionally avoids any secrets configuration.
    # If you fork it, do NOT add real Luraph keys to repository or CI secrets.
    # All payloads processed here must be synthetic test fixtures.
