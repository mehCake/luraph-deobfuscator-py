# Luraph Reverse Mapping VSCode Plugin

This lightweight extension helps you jump from a deobfuscated identifier back to its original obfuscated name using the `mapping.lock` metadata produced by the tooling in this repository.

## Installation

1. Open this repository in VSCode.
2. From the command palette, run **Developer: Install Extension from Location...** and select the `tools/vscode-reverse-mapping` folder, or use `code --install-extension` pointed at this directory.

The extension is fully JavaScript-basedâ€”no build step is required.

## Usage

1. Open any file in the deobfuscated workspace.
2. Select (or copy) the readable identifier you want to trace.
3. Run the command **Luraph: Find Original Identifier** from the command palette.
4. The extension loads `mapping.lock` (or `mapping.json` as a fallback), finds the original obfuscated names, and lets you choose a match if multiple candidates exist.
5. Once selected, the extension searches the workspace for the original identifier and navigates to the first match.

If the identifier cannot be located, the extension displays the mapping location so you can inspect the metadata manually.

## Requirements

- A `mapping.lock` (or `mapping.json`) generated by the deobfuscation pipeline.
- VSCode 1.74.0 or later.

No session keys are stored; the extension only reads mapping metadata already present in the workspace.
